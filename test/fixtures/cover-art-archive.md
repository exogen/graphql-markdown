digital release, the image associated with it in a digital media store).

### Release

A [release](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Release) represents the
unique release (i.e. issuing) of a product on a specific date with specific
release information such as the country, label, barcode, packaging, etc. If you
walk into a store and purchase an album or single, they’re each represented in
MusicBrainz as one release.

present for this release from the [Cover Art Archive](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Cover_Art_Archive).

</tbody>
</table>

### ReleaseGroup

A [release group](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Release_Group) is
used to group several different releases into a single logical entity. Every
release belongs to one, and only one release group.

Both release groups and releases are “albums” in a general sense, but with an
important difference: a release is something you can buy as media such as a CD
or a vinyl record, while a release group embraces the overall concept of an
album – it doesn’t matter how many CDs or editions/versions it had.

[Cover Art Archive](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Cover_Art_Archive). A
release in the release group will be chosen as representative of the release
group.
